### This session has only theory part

- Monolithic vs Microservices ?
- Security groups (Firewalls) ?
- Project description ?

### Points to remeber
- To connect from one server to another server we use "telnet <to-which-IPaddress> port"
  Usage ---> telnet 3.34.345.0 8080
- If telnet is not installed ---> sudo yum install telnet -y
- If you type "ipconfig" you will get all details, IPv4 is my PrivateIP, IP under default gateway is modem.
  IPv4 are exhausting and we are upgrading to IPv6 till then we can use IPv4. We have 2power32 IPaddresses,
  If we allocate all these we get problems so they brought "NAT" Network Address Translation, However Latency
  will become slow is nothing but time to respond.
